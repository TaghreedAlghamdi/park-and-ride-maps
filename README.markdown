# Park and Ride Maps

This web application uses Google Maps APIs to provide park and ride directions. You enter an origin and destination and the application looks for a good place to park and switch to public transportation.

The data sources and searching could use some work, and I'm sure you can find some bugs, but this is just a little weekend project for now. I hope to make it snazzy with some options in the future. (e.g. a server side component to perform "Place Adds" on the Google Places API).

# Try it out

I'm hosting it on my website: [http://stephensearles.com/parkandride/](http://stephensearles.com/parkandride/). Please be courteous, though, I'm under the free use constraints of the Google APIs.

# Notes on development

This project is developed using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).
